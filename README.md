Pandoroid Radio
===============
Status: Functional!

Notice: Desktop client AIR credential switch
	
In order to get higher quality audio (192kbps MP3), a switch was made to use credentials from the desktop client effectively breaking use of the app for all but those with Pandora One accounts.

This is eventually going to be a full-featured [Pandora Radio](http://www.pandora.com/) client for Android-based devices.  Due to failings in the proprietary application provided by Pandora Radio themselves (the most glaring being audio quality issues), this application is being designed with three focuses in mind: _stability_, _intuitiveness_, and _configurability_ (in that order).

Check out the project's home page (http://aregner.com/android/pandoroid/) for details.

At the moment, the application is just about completely functional, with a few manageable bugs. Stability wise, things aren't looking so good. For any difficulties, the general rule of thumb is to restart the app. Feedback is welcome and encouraged.
