Pandoroid Radio
===============
Status: Functional!

This is eventually going to be a full-featured [Pandora Radio](http://www.pandora.com/) client for Android-based devices.
Due to failings in the proprietary application provided by Pandora Radio themselves (the most glaring being audio quality issues),
this application is being designed with three focuses in mind: _stability_, _intuitiveness_, and _configurability_ (in that order).

The project's home page (http://aregner.com/android/pandoroid/) is outdated,
but can be viewed for some background information into the app, and other miscellaneous details.

At the moment, the application is just about completely functional, with a few manageable bugs.
For any difficulties, the general rule of thumb is to restart the app. Feedback is welcome and encouraged.

For the most up-to-date version be sure to check out the branches at
[Tortel](https://github.com/Tortel/pandoroid.git) and [dylanPowers](git@github.com:dylanPowers/pandoroid.git).

## Note about Using the Code
This version uses the [ActionBarSherlock] (http://actionbarsherlock.com/) compatibility library to give the Android 4.0 styling to the older Android versions.  
To edit and compile the source, check out the [usage] (http://actionbarsherlock.com/usage.html) page, under Including In Your Project.  
You will need the latest ADT, have the latest Android APIs installed (Currently version 15 (4.0.4)), and make sure the build target is API 15.
For help with project setup in eclipse, feel free to contact [dylanPowers](https://github.com/dylanPowers) (email is in the commits ;).
