Pandoroid Radio
===============

Notice: The app at this moment is broken!

This is eventually going to be a full-featured [Pandora Radio](http://www.pandora.com/) client for Android-based devices.  Due to failings in the proprietary application provided by Pandora Radio themselves, this application is being designed with three focuses in mind: _stability_, _intuitiveness_, and _configurability_ (in that order).

Check out the project's home page (http://aregner.com/android/pandoroid/) for a few out dated details and the old broken .apk.
